        <h2>The Description of Bitterleaf Soup</h2>
        <p>Bitter Leaf Soup, also known as Ofe Onugbu is a popular Nigerian soup.
            Bitter leaf Soup is peculiar to the Igbo tribe of Eastern Nigeria. 
            A lot of non-Igbos shy away from bitter leaf soup (Well,  I did for 
            the longest time) because they think that, due to its name, it is a 
            very bitter soup. But they cannot be more wrong; Ofe Onugbu does not 
            taste bitter in the slightest. The leaves have to be thoroughly washed 
            to get rid of the bitterness before it is added to the soup.</p>
            <p>I love Ofe Onugbu, it is my second favourite Igbo soup, itâ€™s right
            after the glorious Ofe Owerri. Ofe Akwu comes third.</p>
