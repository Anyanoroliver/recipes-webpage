        <h2>The Description of Yam Porridge</h2>
        <p>Yam Porridge can also be referred to as yam soup. It is mainly yam cooked with ingredients and the resulting dish contains 
            some soupy liquid. It is usually not cooked with added vegetables but I always add a little to add some green colour to the 
            meal.</p>

                        using dry fish, add it now.</li>
                    <li>When the yams have got a good boil, add the onions, ground crayfish, pepper, stock cubes, palm
