        <h2>The Description of Oha Soup</h2>
        <p>Ora (Oha) soup is native to the South Eastern Nigeria. It is a very traditional soup similar to the bitterleaf soup 
            but cooked with Ora leaves. Ora (Oha) Soup is special because the tender ora leaves used in preparing this soup recipe 
            are seasonal unlike their bitterleaf counterpart which can be found all year round.</p>
